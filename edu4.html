in 2017, after finishing high school, I went to high school. My school name is Ad-Diniah Islamic High School. The school is also close to my residential area only takes 15-20 minutes away from home.It was a fun and challenging time for me because this is where I started living without my parents, this school also taught me to live more independently. All my needs have to be done by myself.
<p>
I am grateful to be far away from my parents but I have a very good friend who always accompanies me and is able to return my emotions to a stable state when I am angry or sad.For me to be in this boarding school there are pros and cons. The kindness that I can get out of my comfort zone can also shape me into a useful human being. I was able to manage my time more thoroughly and be consistent in my studies both spiritually and physically.The worst part is the toxic environment I was once humiliated by my warden for a mistake that wasn't from me.My emotions quickly changed due to human pressure and unkind words.
<p>
But as a result thanks to my patience in this school I was able to become an excellent student every year and become an assistant chief superintendent even though I felt unworthy. And this school also got me to where I am now. Although my SPM results are not very outstanding but I am proud to be proud of the school and the two people I love
