In October 2022, I became a student of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM). Although I took a field that is not well known or known by others but I think the decision to pursue an education in this field is the right decision.I've also had the opportunity to meet some crazy people like me also they always kind for me. I am currently in my 4th semester before finishing my 5th semester. I'm almost finished with my diploma.
<p>
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm a university student. At first my parents did not like me to continue my studies in this field because my father wanted me to continue my studies in religion because I came from a religious high school. But I was stubborn and wanted to study the field I had already chosen. In the end, my parents just accept as long I continue my studies.
