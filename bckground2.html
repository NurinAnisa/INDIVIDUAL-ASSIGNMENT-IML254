Hi let me introduce myself first the name given by both my parents is Nurin Anisa Binti Anuar my name is inspired from a surah that is in the Al-Quran, namely surah "an-nisa" and Nurin inspired from the name of my mother's friend.The nickname I use to this day when I'm at home is "Adik". My mother's family also called me "Adik" even though they were younger than me.Also,My best friend calls me" Nuin "and"Yeen."

In 2024, I will be 20 years old. I was born on 1 september 2004 in General Hospital Bukit Mertajam,Penang.When I was growing up my mother told me the story of when she wanted to give birth to me. I had planned to give birth on 31 August,2004, but my mother said I was a little stubborn and didn't want to go out that day. On 1st September, I was born.I have 2 siblings and I am the youngest child in my family. I have a sister named Nurul Ashikin. My age gap with my sister is equal to 4 years.

At first I wanted to be a lawyer because I liked to watch movies or series in the thriller genre or investigate but due to not having the blessing of my parents I canceled my desire to become a lawyer. Although I am a former student from a religious school I have the opportunity to become a Shariah lawyer but the blessing of the parents is more important to me.So I decide to take course that was I studying in University now.Even though I got excellent result in SPM I don't want to continue what I study in secondary school.
My favorite food is definitely from my mother's cooking but when eating out I like to eat koeytiaw kungfu.
