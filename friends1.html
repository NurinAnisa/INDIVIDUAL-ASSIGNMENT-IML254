I have a lot of friends, but this is my best friend from 2017. We started friend at the beginning of high school, and I used to call my friends Tira and Anii.In the beginning, I was just a friend with Tira , but in the middle year we started friend with Anii. They are a place to tell stories and ride on the shoulder to tell all the problems and stories that I experienced. My bestfriends is very important and valuable to me. They were a second home to me without them, so I lost my wings.Every friendship must have its ups and downs. How could it be that my best friend and I have never fought.
<h4 style="background-color:#CAA6A6;">
We have fought because of a misunderstanding between me and them. This fight took more than a week for us to fix. For me, my friend is very mature and good at solving this problem. I am proud to have friends like them.Even though now each other's time is limited unlike before, this relationship has never been broken. Each has her own career and her own way of life. Only during holidays do we take the opportunity to meet and exchange news. I hope this relationship will not be broken until heaven.

My friend's name is Ahsana but I call her Mah.We met at the end of 2020 when we were both 16 years old. Because he's a new student, I don't get along with him very well.At first, I thought she was arrogant, but at the end of the day, she was lovely, kind, and crazy like me.Because I was sitting in the same room as him 1 our relationship became more intimate. We also often share stories with each other, such as expressing feelings or problems experienced.We work at the same workplace after high school.
<h4 style="background-color:#A87C7C;">
When we were working, whenever we both got paid, Ahsana and I would go out for a walk together no matter where we were going. Often we will go out to go to a viral cafe or spend time at the beach.When every semester break, Ahsana and I would go out to talk about whatever happened at university and so on. Even though I have other good friends, I can't deny that Ahsana is also half of my family, without her my life would be empty. A friend like him should not be wasted but deserves to be cherished and loved. For me, the presence of Mah in my life is a blessing and valuable. I hope that this relationship will not be interrupted. So that God preserve this relationship up to heaven.

<h4 style="background-color:#EBD4D4;">
Before our acquaintance became closer and closer I was just an outsider who was invited into their acquaintance. At first I didn't know all my housemates because some were from different fields. I only met Farisha, Wasi, and Meen. When the 2nd semester started I was a bit awkward because I wasn't sitting in college, instead I was sitting outside, in a rented house, that was the first moment I met my housemates, Yana and Miro. The six of us are still housemates until now.

<h4 style="background-color:#FDE49E;">
Day by day our relationship is getting closer and I am comfortable with all of them. I'm thankful to have friends like them, they never count on me and always make me laugh if I'm in a rented house.Although our acquaintance is not too long, each one is very loving and annoying.I also hope that this relationship that has been built will not be broken, but will become more loving day by day. It's a lie to say I don't love them. Those who were there when I was up and down. I really appreciate their presence in my life.
