           <h3>Hi let's talk about my little family.</h3>
<h4 style="background-color:#B7C4CF;">
<p>
<h3 style="font-family:Monaco;">My father's name was Anuar Bin Razali. My father was born on September 29, 1975. Dad. My father was a loving and responsible man. He has a wide and tall body. If I want to find a husband, I will find a husband who is like my father, who is funny, loving and has a very good character.
<p>
My mother's name is Lijah Binti Kamen. Mother was born on April 16, 1976. My mother was a homemaker. My mother was a strict and loving person. He took good care of us.If I had the chance to be a wife and a mother I would take my mother as an inspiration.I have a sister. My sister's name is Nurul Asyikin. My sister is 24 years old and a graduate in the field of Sharia. She was a loving person like my mother and never counted on food or money.
<p>
Even though I don't have a lot of family , it has made me feel at happy and at peace. For me there are no siblings that many do not have an impact on me because my parents will be more than happy to give us the love and needs that we want. My parents used to take us on holiday in Malaysia even though it was only 3 days and 2 nights. The trip gave me a lot of memories and experiences. My parents have never had a problem with stingy when it comes to children. We were not raised in luxury, but we were raised in a modest but adequate way.To be honest, without the blessings of my parents ' prayers, I wouldn't be where I am today. They taught us both science and religion. I owe a lot to my parents. I hope that one day I will be able to give back to my parents.</h3>

<h3>I have 3 cats named John, Johnny and lion. The one I've been looking forward to the most is John. Each of them has its own character and subtlety. For me, defending cats can reduce stress and make the situation at home more happy. At first I was afraid of cats but my father took the first cat we defended. The cat's name is "Bu" because of its grey fur. I don't have a long distiny to care of Bu after a year away Bu has lost and not coming home. I'm sad, but I have to accept my fate.</h3>

<h1>A Family Is Like A Circle</h1>
<h5>Published by Family Friend Poems July 2006 with permission of the Author.<h1>
<p>
<h3>A family is like a circle.
The connection never ends,
and even if at times it breaks,
in time it always mends.<h3>
<p>
<h3>A family is like the stars.
Somehow they're always there.
Families are those who help,
who support and always care.<h3>
<p>
<h3>A family is like a book.
The ending's never clear,
but through the pages of the book,
their love is always near.<h3>
<p>
<h3A family is many things.
With endless words that show
who they are and what they do
and how they teach you so you know.<h3>
<p>
<h3>But don't be weary if it's broken
or if through time it's been so worn.
Families are like that -
they're split up and always torn.<h3>
<p>
<h3>But even if this happens,
your family will always be.
They help define just who you are
and will be a part of you eternally.<h3>
