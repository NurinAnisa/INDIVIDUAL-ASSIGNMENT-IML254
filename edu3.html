2011 was my first year of high school. The name of my high school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Bakap Indah. The school was established in 2009.The school is close to my house, only 3-5 minutes away.My experience in this school is too much and I also make good friends who are very good and help me when in class.I am not a best student, but I try to be a good student every year.2016 was the year for me to take the UPSR exam .
That was the year I had the most trouble in elementary school because the syllabus of the book changed and the era of high-level thinking questions began.At the end of the year, I learned a lot of things. The teacher also took us to Malacca-kuala Lumpur after the UPSR examination also brought us a big meal before the end of my school days.
